# CLT
Central Limit Theorem

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.

This program proves that theory. It allows users to roll dice and then it draws a histogram of returns. The more dice you roll and the more times you roll (creating a large number of iterates), you will see that returns will get distributed normally, resembling a bell shape.
